# Reflection Set Kata

Build a class that dynamically instantiate an implementation of a Set of string (HashSet, TreeSet etcâ€¦) and prints its content.

You must handle the following errors by logging those sentences :

ClassNotFoundException: This class does not exist

NoSuchMethodException: This class has no parameterless constructor

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: No implementation of Set chosen

all other exceptions : This class does not implement Set
