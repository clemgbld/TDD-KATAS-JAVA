# Reflection Set Kata

Build a class that dynamically instantiate an implementation of Set (HashSet, TreeSet) and prints its content.

You must use reflection to achieve this goal and you must handle the following errors by logging those sentences :

ClassNotFoundException: This class does not exist

NoSuchMethodException: This class has no parameterless constructor

all other exception linked to the dynamic class instantiation : This class does not implement Set
